<B>Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?</b>
<BR>
The work that I did in this course was to use reinforcement learning and neural networks to create an AI pirate agent for a treasure hunt game.  For this project, I used a starter code and created a deep Q-learning, REINFORCE, and A2C algorithms.  This allowed the agent to navigate the maze, make decisions, and optimize a path to find the treasure.<BR>

<B>What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?</B><BR>
<BR>
Computer scientists are many things.  They are software developers designing software applications for various industries who write and test code, ensuring applications are reliable and efficient.  They devlop algorithms to solve complex problems and design data structures that improve efficiency in data management.  They help create artificial intelligence that can learn and make decisions and develop AI models for applications like image recognition, language processing, and autonomous systems.  They protect systems from cyber threats and data breaches and design security protocols and encryption methods.  It matters because computer scienctists drive technological advancements, leading to new inventions and improvements in various fields.  They also tackle complex problems, providing solutions that improve efficiency and productivity.  They also develop AI systems that automate repetitive tasks, freeing up human resources for more creative and strategic work.  In essence, computer scientists are shaping the future by creating the technologies that power our world, solve problems, and improve our lives.<BR>

<B>How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?</B><BR>
<BR>
Approaching a problem as a computer scientist often involves a systematic and analytical process.  Being able to understand the problem and figure out ways to solve them is vital to becoming a good computer scientist.<BR>

<b>What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?</b><BR>
<BR>
First my ethical responsibility is to the end user by protecting the privacy so that data is collected, stored, and used in a way that respects user privacy.  Being transparent with how their data is being used and the purpose of the data being collected.  Avoiding bias in algorithms and data that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups by regularly auditing and testing systems to ensure that are fair and equitable.  Responsibility to the organization include integrity by being honest and transparent in my work and communications.  Complying to all legal and regulatory requirement are a must.  Continuously update my skills and knowledge to stay current with industry standards and best practices.  By adhering to these ethical responsibilities, you can ensure that your work as a computer scientist contributes positively to both the users you serve and the organization you work for.
